+ **Background**:
Trees are vital. They give us oxygen, store carbon and give life to whole world's wildlife. People are attracted to live and work in surroundings. Companies benefit from a healthier and happier workforce if there are parks and trees nearby. Therefore, parks and trees would become an more vital component of urban life. People must respect them and protect them for the future.

+ **Dataset**: 
The dataset our group used is '2015 Street Tree Census - Tree Data' from open NYC
(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/pi5s-9p35). This data includes tree species, diameter and perception of health.
